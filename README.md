# LEO - Looking to Eliminate A(O)utism 
###build & developed by Team Pegasus
LEO is about design, development & evaluation of a Smart Toy compatible with mobile technology/application specially and specifically designed for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to overcome their short time memory issue. This will help normal children (specially age 2-4) to identify new objects while they are playing with this toy.

LEO's technology base is engineered with an IoT (Internet of Things) device which is basically a toy car compatible with an Android mobile application to control/navigate the car.

        "in this repository we will be share our Arduino Code, Wiring 
        schematic & Android mobile app source code"
